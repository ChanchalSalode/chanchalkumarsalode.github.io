    <h1>Chanchal Kumar Salode</h1>
    <p>I’m a fourth-year PhD student at IIT Delhi, advised by Prof. Prasanna Ramamoorthy. Currently, my research focuses on operations research and optimization. I build mathematical models applicable to transportation and logistics and design algorithms to solve large-scale optimization problems.

       Before joining my PhD program, I worked as a research associate at the Indian Institute of Management, Indore, under the guidance of Prof. Saurabh Chandra.</p>

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>
  I’m interested in combinatorial optimization, large‑scale optimization algorithms, and machine learning techniques. My current research focuses on formulating mathematical models (MILP and MINLP) and solving large‑scale transportation and logistics problems using exact algorithms and machine learning methods.

      <p>Metro timetabling and operational strategies—rolling‐stock assignment, short‐turning, and skip‐stop—are integrated into three optimization models that minimize costs, waiting times, or both, enabling increased bidirectional service with a limited train fleet. These models, deployed on a simplified Santiago Metro Line 1, provide detailed service, running, and dwell‐time calculations for both peak and off‐peak operations.</p>
